## How to edit your website

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Janna! This is a simple website that should be easy to edit directly on this GitHub repo.

You can explore the files here and click the little pencil icon to make a change.

There is no fancy setup needed, it's just boring HTML files in this repo. When you make a change, give Netlify a minute or two to deploy it before second-guessing yourself.

1. __Want to change the homepage?__

    Make changes in `index.html`

1. __Want to change the "Current Projects" page?__

    Make changes in `current-projects.html`

1. __Want to change the "FAQs" page?__

    Make changes in `faqs.html`

1. __Want to change the "Contact" page?__

    Make changes in `contact.html`

1. __Want to swap out an image?__

    You can do that in the image folder. If you upload a new one, you'll need to update the HTML where you want to use it

1. __Changing the Navbar or Footer?__
    You'll need to do this in each of the 4 HTML files. (This is tedious but keeps things simple for now!)

1. __What is style.css and main.js?__

    The CSS file contains code for the styling, I'd leave that one alone (unless you are feeling brave!)

    The JS file handles the mobile menu open/close behavior. That's it!# kindred-games-net
